# I-Doc



## Purpose 🎯
Our eyes are a crucial part of our body, enabling us to see the world around us. However, our eyes are also vulnerable to various health conditions that can impact our vision and overall eye health. According to WHO, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distant vision impairment around the world. In at least half of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. This 1 billion people includes those with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness due to unaddressed refractive error, cataract , age-related macular degeneration , glaucoma , diabetic retinopathy , as well as near vision impairment.

We aim to reduce the cost of this procedure to make it affordable for a larger mass. Our app can also be used for regular eye power checkup and finding the nearest or the best ophthalmologists in your vicinity. Our app serves as a beacon of light for the poor and needy who cannot afford the expensive wye care facilities.
